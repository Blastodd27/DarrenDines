        <h2>The Craving</h2>

        <p>
          Long flights make you hungry in a weird way. It's not quite exhaustion. Not quite jet lag. Just a hollow need for something hot and savory. By the time I landed in London, that need had been building for hours. I didn't want a sandwich. I didn't want something light. I wanted soup.
        </p>

        <p>
          London is supposed to be one of the best international food cities in the world. I heard that enough times to believe it. My first test was simple: find me a bowl of laksa.
        </p>

        <h2>The Descent</h2>

        <p>
          It’s hard to find Roti King. You walk past a small sign on Doric Way near Euston, find a staircase, and go down. The basement dining room is loud before you even get to the bottom of the stairs. Voices. Clanging bowls. The hiss of a kitchen that doesn't stop. We came during lunch hour and it was packed. Every chair taken. It felt like a good hawker stall. Half tourists who did their research, half locals who know it's the best option around.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no breathing room. I was touching elbows with the table next to me before I even picked up the menu. The group behind us was close enough that I could feel their conversation. No frills. No acoustics. No space. Just people eating.
        </p>

        <blockquote>

        <h2>The Kari Laksa</h2>

        <p>
          I ordered the <strong>Kari Laksa</strong>. My friend ordered the Nasi Lemak. The laksa came out first. The smell hit me before the bowl hit the table. Lemongrass. Sharp, citrusy, clean. It cut through all the noise in the room. Then I saw the broth. Deep orange-gold. The kind of color that tells you there's plenty of coconut milk in there.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/roti-king-kari-laksa.jpeg" alt="Kari Laksa at Roti King, London — coconut broth, thick noodles, and shrimp">

        <p>
          That first spoon was perfect. The coconut base was creamy but not heavy. The lemongrass smell hit me as the steam came up. Cleared my sinuses instantly. Under the richness there was sweetness. The kind that comes from fresh seafood cooking in the broth. The soup tasted like it had been cooking for a long time without tasting tired.
        </p>

        <p>
          The noodles were thick and chewy. They held their texture even in the hot broth. And the shrimp had that snap. You bite down and there's resistance before it gives. That same satisfying pop you get from a good sausage. It's a small thing. But when shrimp is cooked right it's one of the best textures in food. When it's overcooked it's just ruined.
        </p>

          "The coconut base was creamy without being heavy, and the lemongrass fragrance bloomed as the steam came up."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Nasi Lemak</h2>

        <p>
          I kept looking at my friend's plate. The <strong>Nasi Lemak</strong> came with a piece of fried chicken that looked incredibly crispy. Deep golden. The coating looked so craggy and dry that it barely looked like it touched oil. I heard it before I tasted it. Even with all the noise in that room. The chatter. The bowls. The kitchen. I could hear the crunch when my friend cut into it. That's a level of crispy that isn't accidental.
        </p>

        <p>
          It made me drool. I'm not exaggerating. In a basement full of strangers, I was staring at someone else's plate. I'm not proud of it.
        </p>

        <h2>No Frills, No Doubt</h2>

        <p>
          Roti King isn't trying to be anything else. No design concept. No mood lighting. No tasting notes. The tables are packed too close. The room is too loud. It's in a basement. None of that matters. That might be the point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sitting there with a bowl of laksa and looking at the best fried chicken I'd seen all trip, I remembered something important. The best food is usually the least fussy. This felt like what you'd eat in Southeast Asia. Not because it was trying to be exotic. But because it was honest. Someone made this the right way and didn't overthink it.
        </p>

        <p>
          London delivered. The flight hunger is gone. I'd go back tomorrow.
