        <p>
          If you've eaten tacos al pastor outside of Mexico, I need you to forget everything you think you know. What I experienced at <strong>El Huequito</strong> in the heart of Mexico City's Centro Histórico was something else entirely — a dish so perfectly simple, so intensely flavorful, that it made me rethink what street food could be.
        </p>

        <p>
          El Huequito has been around since 1959. It claims to be the birthplace of tacos al pastor in Mexico City, and after one bite, I have zero reason to doubt it.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "The best food in the world doesn't come from a kitchen — it comes from a trompo."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Trompo</h2>

        <p>
          The centerpiece of any al pastor operation is the <strong>trompo</strong> — a towering vertical spit of marinated pork, spinning slowly next to a gas flame. The marinades vary from place to place, but the core is always the same: dried chiles (guajillo, ancho), achiote paste, pineapple, vinegar, and a blend of spices that would make any spice cabinet weep with envy.
        </p>

        <p>
          At El Huequito, the trompo is a thing of beauty. Layer after layer of thin pork slices, marinated until they're practically glowing, stacked and pressed and spinning. The outer layer caramelizes and chars under the flame, creating those crispy, smoky edges that make al pastor <em>al pastor</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The taquero — the person manning the trompo — shaves off thin slices with a long knife in quick, practiced motions. Each slice catches a bit of the charred crust and the juicy, tender interior. It lands on a warm corn tortilla waiting below.
        </p>

        <h2>The Taco</h2>

        <p>
          A proper taco al pastor at El Huequito is small. Maybe three bites. That's by design — you're supposed to eat a lot of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tortilla is doubled up, warm and pliable. The pastor is piled on generously — smoky, sweet, a little spicy, impossibly juicy. On top: a scattering of finely diced white onion, a shower of fresh cilantro, and a chunk of grilled pineapple that adds just enough sweetness to balance the heat.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then you add the salsa. El Huequito offers a green tomatillo salsa that is <strong>electric</strong> — bright, acidic, and with a slow-building heat that creeps up on you. A squeeze of lime ties it all together.
        </p>

        <p>
          I ate seven tacos. I would have eaten more, but I needed to leave room for the horchata.
        </p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

        <p>
          Al pastor is a dish born from cultural collision. When Lebanese immigrants came to Mexico in the early 20th century, they brought shawarma — spit-roasted lamb in pita bread. Mexican cooks adapted it: swapping lamb for pork, pita for tortilla, and adding their own arsenal of chiles and spices. The result is one of the greatest fusion foods ever created.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eating it at El Huequito — a spot that's served it for over 60 years — felt like eating a piece of history. The recipe hasn't changed. The trompo still spins. And every taco is a reminder that the best food comes from tradition, patience, and really good salsa.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "Seven tacos wasn't enough. Next time, I'm bringing an empty stomach and zero regrets."
        </blockquote>
