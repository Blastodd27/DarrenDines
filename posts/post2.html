        <h2>Getting There</h2>

        <p>
          We just came from the Cliffs of Moher. If you haven't been to western Ireland, it's pretty much exactly what you imagine. Super green, narrow roads, and getting anywhere without a car is really hard. We didn't have a car.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/homestead-cliffs.jpg" alt="The Cliffs of Moher, County Clare, Ireland">

        <p>
          Our plan to get to lunch involved a taxi. A €30 fare we paid over the phone to a driver we’d never met, arranged in a one-minute call that felt more like a gamble than a reservation. The drive was only ten minutes, but the whole thing felt like it could go wrong at any second.
        </p>

        <p>
          It didn't go wrong. It went weirdly right. The way the best travel stories usually do.
        </p>

        <h2>The Arrival</h2>

        <p>
          When we pulled up to the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the chauffeurs. Half a dozen of them, standing by their cars in the gravel lot, waiting while their guests ate inside. We just marched out of a random taxi. The chauffeurs all turned to watch us walk in, and I could feel every single one of them staring.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside, it was even funnier. Every other guest was dressed up. Suits, dresses, that easy elegance people have when they eat at Michelin-starred spots all the time. We were in jeans and t-shirts. I had a big backpack that I had to shove under the table because there was nowhere else to put it. We looked like we walked in off a hiking trail. Which, to be fair, we basically did.
        </p>

        <p>
          None of it mattered though. The staff didn't blink. They seated us, gave us menus, and treated us like we belonged there. I learned pretty quickly that's what real hospitality means.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bread and Butter</h2>

        <p>
          Lunch started with bread and Glenilen butter. Might sound weird to get excited about butter, but I’d been waiting to try the real Irish stuff since we landed. It didn't disappoint.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/homestead-bread-butter.jpg" alt="In-house bread with Glenilen butter at Homestead Cottage">

        <p>
          The butter was incredible. Rich, grassy, almost sweet. Deep flavor that told you these cows had been eating really well. I could practically taste the green pastures of County Clare. The bread was warm and crusty, baked in-house, and I had to stop myself from filling up on it before the first course.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "I could practically taste the green grass the cows were eating."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Courses</h2>

        <p>
          First out was the <strong>Flaggy Shore oyster</strong> with champagne and dill. Nothing crazy novelty-wise (it's an oyster) but it was delicious. Clean, briny, and super fresh. Tasted like the sea because it was pulled from it that morning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next came the <strong>Connemara scallop</strong> with ice radish, kohlrabi, buttermilk, and apple. This is where the meal went from good to great. The scallop was silky and sweet, and the sides (crunchy, acidic, creamy) played off each other perfectly. Back-to-back seafood, sitting in a stone cottage five minutes from the ocean. Just made sense.
        </p>

        <h2>The John Dory</h2>

        <p>
          Then the entrees arrived. The <strong>John Dory with dill, apple, and horseradish</strong> stopped me in my tracks.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fish was firm. Not tough like overcooked fish, but firm in the way perfectly cooked fish holds together while still being delicate inside. It had this beautiful coating of dill, and I couldn't figure out how they did it. No sear marks anywhere. No crust. It was too gentle.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/homestead-john-dory.jpg" alt="John Dory with dill, apple, and horseradish at Homestead Cottage">

        <p>
          I asked our waitress how they cooked it. guessed steamed. She went to the kitchen and came back surprised. I guessed right. Steamed, then coated in dill. She told me I had good taste. From then on, she kept a closer eye on our table. Think we earned it.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "Steamed, then coated in dill. No sear, no crust. Just the fish, exactly as it should be."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Lamb</h2>

        <p>
          The <strong>Burren spring lamb</strong> was the other entree. Didn't taste gamey at all. For lamb, that's the highest compliment I can give. The meat was tender, pink in the center, cooked perfectly.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the star was the au jus. I haven't tasted anything like it before. It was super meaty, glossy, and had this depth of flavor like mature cheese. That concentrated, savory quality that comes from time. It coated the lamb and everything else on the plate and made every bite incredibly satisfying.
        </p>

        <h2>Dessert</h2>

        <p>
          Three desserts came out in a row. The <strong>dark chocolate cream with miso caramel and shortbread</strong> was first. Not too sweet, which is exactly how I like it. The batter chocolate sat perfectly against the salty-sweet miso caramel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, the <strong>JJ Corry whiskey chocolate truffle</strong>. Honest truth: I enjoyed the cacao nibs more than the mousse. The nibs had this great crunch and bitterness that cut through the richness.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/homestead-chocolate-truffle.jpg" alt="JJ Corry whiskey chocolate truffle">

        <p>
          Lastly, the <strong>passion fruit pâte de fruit</strong>. Tangy and sweet. Perfect way to end the meal. Left a bright, clean note that made me feel like I could start lunch all over again.
        </p>

        <h2>The Ride Home</h2>

        <p>
          Here's the thing about eating at a Michelin-starred restaurant in rural Ireland without a car. You have to leave. And our hotel was an hour's bus ride away. The bus stop was a 45-minute walk from the restaurant. The bus was due in 15 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Around the time the John Dory arrived, I asked one of the waiters to call a taxi so we could leave right after the meal. Didn't see that waiter again. As we were finishing up, I asked the waitress looking after us (the one who said I had good taste) about the taxi.
        </p>

        <p>
          She disappeared into the kitchen. When she came back, she was smiling.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The head chef will be driving you to the bus stop."
        </p>

        <p>
          I couldn't stop grinning. We walked outside, and there was <strong>Robbie</strong> (the head chef) standing by his truck, ready to go. We climbed in, and I immediately started firing questions at him. What was his background? Where should we eat next? And most importantly, what was in that au jus?
        </p>

        <img src="../images/homestead-chef-robbie.jpg" alt="Darren with Head Chef Robbie at Homestead Cottage">

        <p>
          He told me the jus was made 48 hours in advance. Extra bones ordered specifically for it. Just for the jus. The kind of detail you don't visually see, but definitely feel in every bite. That's what separates great cooking from everything else.
        </p>

        <p>
          Robbie dropped us at the bus stop, we shook hands, and he drove back to his kitchen. We caught the bus with minutes to spare.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "I realized Michelin-starred places are known as much for the hospitality as the food. Homestead Cottage proved it."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The journey there was a mess. The taxi was a gamble. We were the worst-dressed people in the room. And the head chef drove us to our bus stop. I'd do it all again in a heartbeat.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks to Homestead Cottage and Head Chef Robbie for a meal I'll never forget.
